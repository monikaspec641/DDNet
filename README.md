# DDNet
DDNet is a driver monitoring system designed to address the global issue of road accidents. Developed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), DDNet analyzes real-time video of drivers to classify activities as either attentive or inattentive. 
Inattentive driving includes backward posture, talking on the phone, yawning, and sleeping. If detected, DDNet promptly raises an alarm to alert the driver, aiming to mitigate accidents caused by distractions and drowsiness. The system operates day and night, utilizing a self-made dataset covering diverse real-life scenarios to enhance its effectiveness.
## CNN Model
The trained model is in model.py file
## Demo
For demo purpose we have used tkinter python to create a simulator. demo.py contains the code for that.
## Other
Other python files contain dataset preparation and prediction code.
